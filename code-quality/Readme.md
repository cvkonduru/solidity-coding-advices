# Taking Advantage of Code Quality Tools

Code quality is one of the important aspects of writing applications. Good quality code always tends to have fewer bugs and problems when deployed in production. To maintain and improve code quality, there are always some tools specific to the language you are coding with. Similarly, there are some tools for Solidity as well.

In this chapter, we are going to learn about some of the tools that are used while developing Solidity contracts. There are many open source tools available for the Solidity language, and these include code quality tools such as contract graph generators, linters, and code coverage tools. Using these contract graph generators, you can view how the contracts are linked together; using the linters, you can fix possible bugs, errors, and stylistic errors; and using the code coverage tools, you can discover which part of the code is well tested and which part is not covered by the test cases.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

- Installing and using surya commands to generate reports
- Installing and using the solhint linter
- Installing and using the ethlint (also known as solium) linter
- Installing and using the solidity-coverage tool
